# PlantUML Container

[PlantUML](https://plantuml.com) is the next best thing to slice bread.  We use it religously as a primary means to document software via UML and other diagram.  This repo provides a containerized PlantUML capability for continuous integration pipelines.

This leverages the PlantUML jar, with embedded GraphViz, to generate SVGs from *.puml files.
